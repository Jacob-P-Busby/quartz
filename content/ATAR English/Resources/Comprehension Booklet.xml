 <paragraph index="144" node_type="writer">Make sure that you read the questions before analysing the given texts</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="146" node_type="writer">You will be given contextual information about the texts – pay attention to this as it will give you a better understanding of what the text is about</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="148" node_type="writer">DON’T PANIC – remember that you are only constructing 2 paragraphs per response so in reality only need to identify 4 techniques AT THE MOST</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="150" node_type="writer">PLAN your response! This will ensure that your analysis/ argument is consistent and will also mean that you won’t forget what you were going to say … it will relieve stress I PROMISE.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="152" node_type="writer">Make sure that you use SPECIFIC EVIDENCE from the texts – quote where you can.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="154" node_type="writer">Work on integrating your quotes in a seamless way</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="156" node_type="writer">As part of your study (YES STUDY) for English, make sure that you revise the following techniques and conventions:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="157" node_type="writer">Narrative</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="158" node_type="writer">Persuasive</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="159" node_type="writer">Visual </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="166" node_type="writer">PERSUASIVE TECHNIQUES</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="167" node_type="writer">Persuasive language techniques are used by authors to convince readers of their point of view, and to sway them to their point of view. Authors vary their persuasive techniques based upon audience, writing genre, and their own motives. Any language technique can be persuasive if used in different ways, but below are listed many of the persuasive techniques used by writers</paragraph>

 <paragraph index="237" node_type="writer">Have a STRATEGY:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="238" node_type="writer">Conquering comprehension</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="239" node_type="writer">To be successful in the Comprehension Section, it is really important that you have a strategy in place about how you will approach it. Today we will work through some steps that will help you think about developing your own process to tackle this section.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="241" node_type="writer">The question I will be answering is:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="242" node_type="writer">_______________________________________________________________________________</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="243" node_type="writer">The text that I will focus on is:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="244" node_type="writer">_______________________________________________________________________________</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="248" node_type="writer">STEP ONE – FRAME THE TEXT</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="255" node_type="writer">Read the contextual information that is given to you. What do you know or expect about the text’s context, creator or form?</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="262" node_type="writer">STEP TWO – INITIAL IMPRESSIONS</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="264" node_type="writer">Complete a surface level reading. What is the text about?</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="265" node_type="writer">	</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="266" node_type="writer">STEP THREE – SELECT AN ANALYTICAL FOCUS </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="267" node_type="writer">Using the question as a guide, decide on the focus and purpose of your analysis. What key concepts do you need to focus on and what do you understand about these?</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="269" node_type="writer">STEP FOUR – RE-READ AND ANNOTATE                    </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="270" node_type="writer">Re-read the text with your analytical focus in mind. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="271" node_type="writer">Annotate and make notes.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="273" node_type="writer">STEP FIVE – CONSIDER THE EFFFECTS OF TEXTUAL FEATURES</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="274" node_type="writer">Examine your annotations, what are the effects of the textual features that you have identified.</paragraph>

 <paragraph index="483" node_type="writer">TEXT THREE</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="484" node_type="writer">Explain how language features and structure affect your interpretation of Text 3.             </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="485" node_type="writer">Text 3 is the opening of Dave Ritter’s essay, “The Man Without a Face”. It was published in Griffith Review 47: Looking West in February 2015. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="487" node_type="writer">Before I was born, my family arrived in Western Australia from Europe and moved into a ramshackle brick house on three-plus acres in Kelmscott, then a semi-rural locality on the outskirts of Perth. The property featured an orchard that ran down to a wide stream, a minor tributary of the Canning River. The creek – which my family always called ‘the river’ – was full of life when they arrived, including local species of fresh water catfish, colourful pygmy perch, various kinds of molluscs and a range of crustaceans, of which the most marvellous was an abundance of that mighty crayfish endemic to south-western Australia, the marron. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="488" node_type="writer">The river was my father’s delight. He would clamber among the rocks, burning off and clearing brambles when necessary, and would often end up with his white vest, shorts and gumboots generously daubed with the rich, aromatic mud from the shallow pools beneath the paperbarks. Until his last years, Dad would recall his instant love of the river – an affection that deepened when he noticed big marron clambering across submerged stones and logs in broad daylight. Once they’d settled in the house, my family would periodically fish a plate of marron out of the river for a meal of imperial quality over which my father, once a frightened and penniless refugee, would preside over contentedly, extolling the beneficent wealth of his adopted state. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="490" node_type="writer">Then one day a stranger came, driving his vehicle close to the river on the opposite bank. It was over in a matter of days. Using a spear and swimming with goggles where the water was deep enough, he took out marron by the sackful in a carnage that was efficient and final. The stock was devastated and never recovered. The few marron that survived to be caught in my lifetime were treated with solemnity and returned to the water, in the hopes of supporting the recovery of the species. It didn’t happen. I never shared marron with my Dad – they had simply become too precious to eat. The devastation occurred before I was born, but conceit of mind has conspired to stalk me with a persistent night terror of those events. In my recurring dream the man with the spear has no face, the sacks are always full and I cannot console my father. </paragraph>
