>[!example]+
John owns a small barbershop. The shop is owned by one person who manages it all and makes sure it runs smoothly. When they make a [[B.M.E/Glossary#Profit|profit]] he keeps it all, but if they get fined he has to pay it. His work hours are very flexible, as he has no boss to report to, but he has to show up if something happens, even if he doesn't want to. When his [[B.M.E/Glossary#Tax|tax]] return comes, all of the money made is reported as personal income
## Partnership
A partnership is similar to a sole proprietorship, but with multiple people managing it. They have to make decisions together, and will have terms they all agreed on when the business started

- Easy to establish
- More resources
- Shared costs
- More people to help
- Longevity

- Unlimited liability
- Potential for conflict

> [!example]+
> The Smith family own a restaurant, that all adults in the family own. All family members have equal say in how it is run, and contribute to make it successful. They split the profits equally but don't have the burdens that companies deal with. Members of the partnership can be added and removed easily, such as if someone dies or turns 18, meaning it can last across multiple generations

## Corporation
A corporation is a separate [[B.M.E/Glossary#Legal Entity|legal entity]] that can hold assets and have a bank account, just like a real person. It is owned through shares, with shareholders making decisions and profiting through the value of the share and dividends.

- Better ability to raise capital
- Liquidity
- Longevity
- Limited liability

- Cost and complexity
- Reporting requirements
- Managerial demands
- Possible loss of control
- Double taxation

> [!example]+ Example 
> If John wanted to expand his barbershop and decide he wants to incorporate it. He has to go through a lot of paperwork to start a corporation, issue shares, make himself C.E.O, etc. Now, if the barbershop goes bankrupt, he can still keep all of his money and property. He can also give shares to other people, meaning that they own part of the barbershop, and if they have enough, they may have some control over the barbershop. As C.E.O, John has to fulfill many legal requirements for the company, such as reporting to shareholders, managing records, etc.
