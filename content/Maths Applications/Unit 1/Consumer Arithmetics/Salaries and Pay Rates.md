## Salaries
A salary is the amount of money someone is paid over the year. A salary is fixed, meaning that no matter how much you work, the salary stays the same. Salaries are usually given to full time or permanent part time workers, who usually have a consistent schedule, meaning that pay is easy to calculate this way.

## Pay Rates
A pay rate is a smaller chunk of a salary for a smaller period of time. These are used to calculate paychecks, such as a fortnightly pay rate given to an employee every second Friday.

A pay rate is calculated as $\frac {S}{P}$ where S = Annual salary and P = number of periods in a year

>John works a full time office job and earns \$104,000 a year. His fortnightly pay rate would be $\$\frac{104000}{26}$, or $4000
