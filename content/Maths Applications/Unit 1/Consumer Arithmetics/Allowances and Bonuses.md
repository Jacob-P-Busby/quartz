## Allowances
Some jobs have requirements for travel, equipment, etc that are provided by the employee, not the employer. These jobs usually will pay the employee an allowance so they can purchase and maintain things that the employer would otherwise pay for.

> John works at an office job located in a remote place. The dress code requires that he needs clothes that are professionally laundered, and he has to drive a long way to get to work. His employer gives him \$100 a week so he can fuel his car, and \$20 a week for him to maintain his clothes. With his pay rate of \$1500 a week included, he gets payed $$1500 + 100 + 20$$ a week, or \$1620 in total

## Bonuses
Many jobs will offer an incentive for working hard, meeting deadlines, and overall being a productive employee. These are offered as bonuses on top of the usual pay the employee is given.

> [!example]+
> John has worked very hard on an assignment for two weeks and managed to get done before the deadline. As a reward, his employer gave him \$500 as a bonus. This means that on top of the \$1620 dollars a week he is being paid, his next pay check will be \$2120

>[!example]+
> John found another offer at a closer office and decided to change jobs. His new employer offered \$2100 a week, as well as a \$20 clothing allowance. They also give a sign on bonus of one week's pay. John first paycheck will be $2100 + 20 + 2100$, or \$4220 in total
