This website was made using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz), a static site generator that turns Markdown (the way I take notes on my computer) into a wiki-like website. It's hosted using GitHub Pages, a free way to put files on the internet. All of the pages we have are formatted in [Obsidian flavoured Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax)

All the notes used here are written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a note taking app that uses Markdown, a simple format, to write files with ease. This also allows us to link all the notes together in a wiki-like fashion.

Any help is appreciated, from class notes to maintenance. I'm happy to teach Obsidian to anyone interested. Just let me know on Teams if you want to help and learn
